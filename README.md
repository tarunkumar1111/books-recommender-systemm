## Installation  

### Prerequisites:  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (Python package manager)  

### Steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/tarunkumar1111/books-recommender-systemm.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd books-recommender-systemm  
   ```  

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash
